- Hi, I’m Robert Bass (@Rbass3), PhD candidate at Scripps Research.
- I work at UF Scripps Biomedical Research in Jupiter, Fl; my advisor is Dr. Baoji Xu
- I have a background in Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience, and I’m interested in Bioinformatics.
- I have experience with R (seurat, dplyr, ggplot2), python (scanpy, pandas), imageJ, and managing environments with conda.
- I’m interested in single-cell transcriptomics and using machine learning methods to solve biological questions.
- I have scripts published here that i have used during my PhD. these include sc-RNAseq pipleines: integration, annotation, plotting, etc.
- In each of these scripts, there is a comment at the top describing what the script does.
- If you'd like to contact me, my email is Rbass@scripps.edu
